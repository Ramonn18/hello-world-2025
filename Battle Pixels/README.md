## Day 2
### Why do I want to make a game?

It encourages persistence in tackling complex problems and learning new concepts.
Beyond coding, the process cultivates a wide range of valuable, transferable skills, including:

* #### Problem-solving and critical thinking

* #### Creativity and design thinking

* #### Creating tangible, interactive outcomes

* #### Understanding and applying control structures

I also love games—especially those with rich storytelling and compelling RPG premises.
